## Overview

The Spotify Trends 2023 Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the latest trends in music on the Spotify platform for the year 2023. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we seek to uncover insights into user preferences, popular genres, and emerging artists.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- **models:** Saved machine learning models.
- **images:** Images and visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **src:** Source code files.

## Technologies Used

The key technologies and libraries used in this project include:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis consists of Spotify user listening data for the year 2023. It includes information about track popularity, user preferences, and artist details.

### Data Size:

10,000 records

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Feature engineering

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Understanding the distribution of features
   - Identifying patterns and outliers

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and transforming data for modeling
   - Feature scaling and normalization

3. **Modeling:**
   - Implementing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering
   - Training machine learning models for genre classification

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessing the performance of the recommendation system
   - Evaluating genre classification models

5. **Visualization:**
   - Creating interactive visualizations to showcase trends

## Model Architecture

### Recommendation System:

- Collaborative Filtering with Matrix Factorization

### Genre Classification:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Results

The analysis revealed several interesting trends:

- Top genres among Spotify users
- Emerging artists gaining popularity
- User preferences based on geographical location

Visualizations and detailed results can be found in the [results](/images/results) directory.

## Future Work

- Incorporate more features for genre classification
- Implement user segmentation for personalized recommendations
- Explore additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis
